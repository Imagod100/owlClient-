If you are reading this that means you ether just installed owl client or just looking on the github if so please download OwlClient then come back here but if you didnt get it from github good job! Anyways OwlClient is going to bee a free roblox client with a clean gui and nice features but you are going to need a password and username to get into the client but thats to to stop people from getting away from not getting the wrong password or stuff like that.
